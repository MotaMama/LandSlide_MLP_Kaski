1. Load Nepal district boundaries.
2. Filter to select the Kaski district.
3. Display Kaski region and center the map on it.

4. Load landslide catalog and clip to Kaski.
5. Convert clipped landslides to an image layer.
6. Calculate distance of each pixel to the nearest landslide point.

7. Generate random points in Kaski.
8. Filter these to only keep points >1 km away from landslides.
   → Label them as non-landslide points (label = 0)

9. Label clipped landslide points as landslides (label = 1).
10. Merge landslide and non-landslide points.

11. Load and clip SRTM elevation data to Kaski.
12. Derive slope and aspect from elevation.
13. Calculate mean annual precipitation (2000–2023) using CHIRPS.
14. Stack elevation, slope, aspect, and precipitation into a multiband image.

15. Sample raster values at labeled point locations.
16. Split dataset into training and testing sets.

17. Train Random Forest classifier on training set.
18. Classify raster pixels using trained model to get probability values.

19. Reclassify probability map into 5 risk zones:
    - Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High

20. Compute area of each risk zone in sq km.

21. Perform ROC/AUC evaluation using sampled points.
22. Plot ROC curve and print AUC score.

23. Add a legend to the map for interpretability.
